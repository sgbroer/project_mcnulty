## Project 3 MVP Proposal

### Domain
For Project 3 I plan to examine political engagement in response to the 2016 election through survey data from the Pew Research Center. Although I have no professional experience with this topic, I have personal interest due to being the product of a split household and therefore exposure to very different views not just of the current state of politics and the electorate in America, but of the nature of the change during a time which all sides posit as one of great change. 

### Data
The data I intend to work with is the from the summer 2017 Pew Research Political Typology survey, available online at http://www.people-press.org/dataset/political-typology-2017/. There are 164 features in the dataset, all of which are categorical. Some are paired due to randomization in wording of questions. Some of the variables I intend to utilize are as follows (with some paraphrasing in the descriptions): 

Variable | Description
--------|--------
qb27 (Target) | Since the election, would you say you're paying more, less, or the same amount of attention to politics?
Income | 
Religion | 
Race | 
Age | 
Education | 
Sex | 
Party | Political Party
Party Strength | Strength of feeling of affiliation towards a party
qa1 | Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donal Trump is handling his job as President?
qa1a | Do you approve or disapprove strongly?
qb28 | When you talk politics with people who have a different opinion of Donald Trump than you do is it interesting and informative or stressful and frustrating
qb80 | Is it possible to have economic policies that benefit everyone in the country, or will pretty much every policy end up benefitting some at the expense of others?
qa127 | Is it worse to convinct an innocent person or let a guilty person go free?

Since there are so many, I will continue to play with the data and find correlations

### Known Unknowns
This data set has an abundance of features to select from. One related problem is that the columns in the data set are not particularly clearly label, and so going through and making them intelligible will take some unknown amount of time -- I don't anticipate it being inordinate but not having completed any similar tasks, I am most likely falling victim to the planning fallacy. Additionally, given the plethora of features, I suspect the feature selection process might become arduous. So far most of the modelling we have done seems relativeley straightforward in terms of implementing in code, but it ended up being more difficult than expected for Project 2 so I suspect a similar outcome for this project.

### Unknown unknowns
Probably a lot
